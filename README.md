==========

A Python module for visualizing and tracking ellipsioids through a video file at close to real-time. This process would yield similar data to FACS, ideally.

Example from:
Mazutis, Linas, et al. "Single-cell analysis and sorting using 
droplet-based microfluidics." Nature protocols 8.5 (2013): 870-891.

Todo:
[ ] Introduce cell tracking
[ ] Add real-time image processing feature
[ ] Give real-time metrics for cell size/features
